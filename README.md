### Project Description
Finding autorikshaws has been a real problem for the public, especially for the people who live in the native without uber. The RikshApp registers all the auto-drivers in the locality so that the public can find a auto driver easily. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding autorikshaws has been a real problem for the public, especially for the people who live in the native without uber. this is the problem RikshApp solves.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The auto drivers in a locality can register themselves in the RikshApp and these drivers can either set them as available or unavailable for ride, and the necessary public can checkout the app and hire the available drivers.  

## Technical Details
