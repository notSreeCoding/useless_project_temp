### Project Description
Finding autorikshaws has been a real problem for the public, especially for the people who live in the native without uber. The RikshApp registers all the auto-drivers in the locality so that the public can find a auto driver easily. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding autorikshaws has been a real problem for the public, especially for the people who live in the native without uber. this is the problem RikshApp solves.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The auto drivers in a locality can register themselves in the RikshApp and these drivers can either set them as available or unavailable for ride, and the necessary public can checkout the app and hire the available drivers.  

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
- reactjs, firebase
- firebase
- firebase firestore

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
webapp,
1. autorickshaw-call.web.app : for users to check for the available autos in a locality.
2. driver-dashbroad.web.app : for auto drivers to register themselves and change their availability


# Run

[commands]

This screenshot shows how the user will be able to see the available auto drivers in the locality.

![ss2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035a29ae-da90-459d-8a2e-0b48e34eb5cf)
this screeen shot shows how an auto driver can register himslef on the RiskshApp for the service in which they can changee their availability also

![Screenshot3](Add screenshot 3 here with proper name)
The screenshot shows how the autodrivers can be contacted by the user.

### Project Demo
# Video


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b891478e-c4b9-4c2a-967a-fd844c0537a9


The video demonstrates the whole functionality of the RikshApp in which a particular auto driver registers the auto and then a user requests his service in realtime and contacting him through the mobile number.
